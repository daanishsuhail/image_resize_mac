Image Resize Mac
----------------
 This repo generates a wallpaper that is 2560x1600 which is split into 3 layers. The first layer is the background layer which by default is plain white. The second layer is a 2560x1600 image which randomly chooses whether every pixel in the image is black or transparent. The final layer minimizes the image by 4%.
